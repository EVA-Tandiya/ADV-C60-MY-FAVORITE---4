        <p> Every one of us has some kind of liking/ disliking for certain things in life. Similarly I love drawing because drawing do not cost much and is always fun. Drawing is my favorite hobby.

            I cannot imagine a colorful life without drawing. My greatest inspiration is my mother who always encourages me to design her dresses. It is my believe that to display your art you do not have to be a great artist.

            You just have to make a unique piece. So get your paint brush and pencil and start drawing.

            When I am blue I cheer myself up by drawing something so that I can make myself happy. Drawing is a way for me to show my creativity. However drawing is not as easy as it seems to be. It needs a lot of devotion as well as practice. I can never feel bored when I have my colors with me. My colors are my best friend.</p>
